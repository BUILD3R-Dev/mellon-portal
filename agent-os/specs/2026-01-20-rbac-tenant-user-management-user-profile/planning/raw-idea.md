# Raw Idea: RBAC, Tenant User Management & User Profile

**Feature: RBAC, Tenant User Management & User Profile**

This spec covers the final three items in Milestone 1: Foundations:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (#8)** — Enforce Agency Admin, Tenant Admin, and Tenant Viewer permissions across all routes and API endpoints

2. **Tenant User Management (#9)** — Allow Tenant Admins to invite, list, and deactivate view-only users within their tenant

3. **User Profile & Settings (#10)** — Build profile page for users to update their name and password

These complete the foundational infrastructure for the multi-tenant portal.
