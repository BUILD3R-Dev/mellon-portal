# Raw Idea: Tenant Management & Branding System

**Feature: Tenant Management & Branding System**

This spec covers three related roadmap items:

1. **Tenant Management (Agency Admin)** — Create CRUD interface for agency admins to create, edit, and deactivate franchise brand tenants

2. **Tenant Branding Configuration** — Build settings page for uploading tenant logo and configuring accent color that applies across the tenant UI

3. **Co-Branded Layout System** — Implement dynamic layout that displays Mellon logo alongside tenant logo and applies tenant accent colors to UI elements

These are foundational features for a multi-tenant SaaS portal where an agency (Mellon) manages multiple franchise brand tenants, each with their own branding.
