# Report Week Foundation - Raw Idea

**Feature: Report Week Foundation**

This spec covers the foundational items for the Report Weeks feature:

1. **Report Week Data Model (#11)** — Define schema for report weeks with start/end dates, status (draft/published), and tenant association

2. **Report Week CRUD (#12)** — Build interface for agency admins to create, list, and manage report weeks per tenant with date validation

3. **Draft/Publish Workflow (#13)** — Implement status transitions with publish action that locks the report week from further edits

This is the foundation for the report weeks system that will later include rich text content sections (narrative, initiatives, needs from client) and preview/published views.
