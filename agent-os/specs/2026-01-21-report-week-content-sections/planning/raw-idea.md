# Raw Idea

**Feature: Report Week Content Sections**

This spec covers the content authoring capabilities for report weeks:

1. **Rich Text Editor Integration (#14)** — Add rich text editor component for authoring weekly narrative content with formatting support

2. **Weekly Narrative Section (#15)** — Build editable narrative field on report week with autosave and preview functionality

3. **Initiatives Section (#16)** — Add initiatives field for listing current marketing initiatives with bullet point formatting

4. **Needs From Client Section (#17)** — Add field for agency to communicate action items or requests to the client

These build on the Report Week Foundation (items 11-13) which is already complete. The report weeks CRUD and draft/publish workflow are in place.
